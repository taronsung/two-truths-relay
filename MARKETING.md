**Title:** I built a viral social game in a weekend - Two Truths Relay (Next.js + Framer Motion)

**Body:**
Hey everyone! I just shipped Two Truths Relay - a chain-reaction social bluff game that transforms the classic "2 truths and a lie" into something viral.

**How it works:**
1. Someone sends you a link with 3 statements
2. You guess which one is the lie
3. You add YOUR own 2 truths + 1 lie
4. Share with friends to continue the relay
5. Watch the tree grow as friends branch off!

**Tech stack:**
- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion for animations
- Supabase-ready schema

**What I'm proud of:**
- The cozy pastel design system
- Buttery smooth animations (200-500ms micro-interactions)
- Natural viral loop built into the core experience
- Works great on mobile

Would love feedback! What features would make this more fun for your friend group?

**Title:** Built a viral party game app in a weekend - would love your feedback!

**Body:**
Just launched Two Truths Relay - a social bluff game that makes the classic "2 truths and a lie" go viral.

The viral loop is built into the core experience:
- You HAVE to share to continue the relay
- Each share creates a branch on the tree
- The tree visualization shows how far the game has spread

Try it: https://dlrp9n-3000.csb.app/demo

What I'm looking for:
1. Is the onboarding clear enough?
2. What would make you share this with friends?
3. Any features you'd add?

The core mechanic: classic "2 truths and a lie" but with a twist.

Every guess creates a branch. Every share continues the relay. The tree visualization shows how far the game spreads through your network.

Tech stack:

The viral loop is built into the core experience:

Receive link → Guess → Create your set → SHARE to continue

You literally can't play without spreading it. K-factor > 1 by design.

Pastel gradients, soft shadows, playful animations. Made people want to share because it looks beautiful.

## Analytics Tracking Suggestions

Add these events to track viral growth:

1. `relay_started` - New chain created
2. `guess_submitted` - Someone played
3. `node_created` - Someone added their statements
4. `share_clicked` - Share button clicked
5. `share_completed` - Share actually sent
6. `invite_opened` - New user from invite

K-factor = (shares per user) × (conversion rate)

Target: K > 1 for viral growth
